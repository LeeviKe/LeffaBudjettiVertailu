# Movie score quiz

## This application is a game, where the player has to guess between 2 movies, which one has the higher viewer score in TMDB. The game continues as long as the player keeps guessing right, and when they fail, the points will be showcased.

## Materials used:

### I used the TMDB api for getting data about movies used in the game. https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started

### I used AI (chatGPT) a lot during the making of this application. However, I didn't use it for generating code or anything like that, but for learning purposes, such as for understanding how different commands work and what they do. I also utilized AI on the HTML side for giving examples, inspiration and just for a quick check on how certain things are done (basic stuff such as how to change colors, move classes around etc). Overall, I used AI a lot, but the things I asked from it were things that could have been found from the internet really easily, and AI only sped up the finding process.
